    I keep becoming more and more scared of the feeling of unconditional love.
    Sometimes I become fearful that having this constant security will at some
    point, lead me to a life of lethargy and comfort. There is nothing more
    scary to me than having this idle peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    A kind of peace that leads to ill-preparedness and vulnerability. However,
    there isn't any need for this insecurity. By thinking it, and nurturing it
    into existence you already adhere to its sentiment. The mere thought that
    you could drop your standards, and be equally happy should play no role in
    ultimately doing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I appreciate the word 'unconditional', though it functions within its
    context. Maybe another way to think of 'unconditional' love is to consider
    that it is unconditional given the state of being that you occupy currently,
    keeping you in the state to preserve what aspects you love about yourself,
    and are loved for.
