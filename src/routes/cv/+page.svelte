			I am a computer science and mathematics student seeking to undertake
			a summer internship specialising in programming, computer science,
			mathematics or design. My course has taught me fundamental computer
			science and mathematical insight. I wish to apply this knowledge in
			a professional context. I would honored to apply my expertise to
			real-world senarios.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am looking for an internship between Juneâ€”September 2023, before
			my 3<sup>rd</sup> and final year at the University of Leeds. Currently,
			I am on exchange at the University of Waterloo, Canada which is held
			as a highly regarded instutuion for computer science.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a highly motivated and adaptable individual that can work
			effectively within teams. I have previous experience in team-based
			positions (in both academic and hospitality roles) has helped me
			understand how to integrate into various teams. I have come to
