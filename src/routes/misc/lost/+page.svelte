    This video, by "Sisyphus 55", semanticially encapsulates my current
    evaluation of my life. Though, I wish it didn't. Some key things that I
    wanted to assert from watching this was:
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
        <b
            >“People like to think of themselves as points moving through time,
            but I think it’s probably the opposite. We’re stationary and time
            passes through us. Blowing like cold wind, stealing our heat.”</b
        >
    </p> -->
  <!-- <p>
        Initially, I regret to agree with this statement. It had a aire of
        hopelessness in which I felt like an example; in the sense my life has
        been spiraling out of my own control. Its far easier to relinquish this
        control to external forces, to use them as blame.
        This withering self
        evalutation is a definite distraction, by trusting this arguement, all
        that arose was pity. Whenever this perspective drifts into mind, I
        always wish to have never encounted it at all. Which would be the case
        if only I had other event happening in my life, I could be distracted
        from this pity too.
    </p> -->
  <!-- <p>
        And yet my belifs knows that this isn't true, it obscures the idea of
        having any kind of improvement, reinforcement, or hope. The only issue
        is being able to retain this viewpoint in every action that I do.
    </p> -->
  <h3>Your envrionment is not to blame for your own confusion</h3>
  <!-- <h3>
        Parse the ideas that come into your head, allow yourself to reason with
        clarity.
    </h3> -->
  <!-- <h3>Contradiction is the key to chaos</h3>
    <h3>
        Its not all a distraction. A false rule is that in order to be
        distracted <i>from</i>
        something, you must be distracted
        <i>by</i> something. Distraction holds your conciousness victim.
    </h3> -->
  <h3>
    Any thought initiated entirely by yourself is important. Always accept your
    own thoughts as relevant and not distractions.
  </h3>
  <!-- <h3>Distractions are then only third-party entities that we commit to.</h3> -->
  <h3>
    Low self-worth is a relevant thought, and hence must be considered
    rationally.
  </h3>
  <h3>Being alone, isn't a solution to feeling alone.</h3>
  <h3>
    Try not to feel, nor put youself in the position, where you have things to
    hide. Forcing yourself into hiding, you'll not be visible when you need to
    be saved, nor always act in accordance with your peers.
  </h3>
  <h3>Compassion is important.</h3>
  <h3>Dopamine codes for the "discrepancy from expectation"</h3>
  <!-- <p>
    The reason that I find this statement to be true, is because of my computer
    graphics project. In this project we had to create our own objectives. I set
    myself too high an objective, and I let myself down. My expectations we're
    high. When I saw my outcome, I definitely did not excrete any dopamine
  </p> -->
  <h3>
    We are a collection of waves. Each wave in this collection can represent a
    different measurement of our existance. Our emotions, our productivity, our
    satisfaction, our health. It is natural that these measurements will
    oscilate as our persepctive on the world changes. However, we can choose to
    create regularity in the evaluation, and equally, we can lead evaluations
    into chaos.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    It's difficult to choose which yeilds a more intresting life and there is no
    obligation to commit to either one.
  </h3>
  <!-- <p>
        There's far to much to do, and it doesn't help that seemingly everyone
        around me knows their path. Asking people countless questions about what
        they did to find their passion doesn't help either. Often the response
        stems from having some commitment that they had prior to their
        realisation. Such as a club, friend or family member edging them to
        persue their passion. What am I meant to do? Transitent by nature, I
        seem to find myself bounding from club to club, from relationship to
        relationship without grounding myself to any of these. Theres a belif
        that at some point it will all become clear, and all I will have to do
        is follow a new passion that will rise someday.
    </p> -->
  <!-- <p>
        In the first section an example of a person in their twenties is
        described as being paralysed by the idea that life can be vast. There's
        so much to think and to feel. However the sheer amount of control they
        have acts as a insurmountable boulder.
    </p> -->
  <!-- <h3>Concentration</h3>
    <p>
        Occasionally, I can't concentrate. Everyone experiences it, and I'd
        argue with you if you said you didn't. But why? It's not productive,
        refreshing, or any of the good things that life has to offer. Clearly,
        it's not something that we choose to do. However, this too can be
        diminished. With enough practice, it's possible. I always used to think
        of monks and esteemed religious personnel as obtaining a third-party
        gift of concentration. But they work hard on it, and they're serious
        about it. About what? The idea that everything at the back of your mind
        can rest until your existential beliefs are handled first. If you think
        about it, religious people might obscure all the existential thoughts
        that they have and construct them into something else.
